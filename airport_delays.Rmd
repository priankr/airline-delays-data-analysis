title: "Airport Delays Data Analysis"
output: html_notebook
---

The data was downloaded from CORGIS Dataset Project: <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/airlines/">Original Dataset</a>

This dataset is all about flights in the united states, including information about the number, length, and type of delays between 2003-2016. The data is reported for individual months at every major airport for every carrier. Additional information is available: http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/help/aviation/html/understanding.html

## Attributes: 
- Airport.Code: The 3 letter code for this airport, assigned by IATA. 
- Airport.Name:	The full name of this airport.
- Time.Label: The "year/month" reported as a string, to make it easier to sort by time periods.	
- Time.Month: The reported month as a number. 0 is January, 1 is February, etc.	
- Time.Month Name: Name of Month
- Time.Year: The reported year as a 4-digit number.	
- Statistics.# of Delays.Carrier: The number of delays and cancellations due to circumstances within the airline's control (e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.) in this month.	
- Statistics.# of Delays.Late Aircraft: The number of delays and cancellations caused by a previous flight with the same aircraft arriving late, causing the present flight to depart late in this month.	
- Statistics.# of Delays.National Aviation System	Integer	The number of delays and cancellations attributable to the national aviation system that refer to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control in this month.
- Statistics.# of Delays.Security	Integer	Number of delays or cancellations caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas in this month.	17
- Statistics.# of Delays.Weather	Integer	Number of delays or cancellations caused by significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) that, in the judgment of the carrier, delays or prevents the operation of a flight such as tornado, blizzard or hurricane in this month.	328
- Statistics.Carriers.Names: The full names of the carriers that reported in.	
- Statistics.Carriers.Total	Integer	The number of carriers that reported flight information during this time period and at this location.	11
- Statistics.Flights.Cancelled:	The number of flights that were cancelled in this month.	
- Statistics.Flights.Delayed:	The number of flights that were delayed in this month.
- Statistics.Flights.Diverted:	The number of flights that were diverted in this month.	
- Statistics.Flights.On Time:	The number of flights that were on time in this month.	
- Statistics.Flights.Total: The total number of flights in this month.

- Statistics.Minutes Delayed.Late Aircraft	Integer	The number of minutes delayed caused by a previous flight with the same aircraft arriving late, causing the present flight to depart late in this month.
Statistics.Minutes Delayed.National Aviation System: The number of minutes delayed attributable to the national aviation system that refer to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control in this month.

As there are quite a few columns it might be helpful to look at a some some subsets of the data.

We can look at three subsets specifically:

- Number of Flights Delayed Overall
- Number of Flights Delayed by Reason
- Duration of Flight Delay

# Summary of Data Analysis

On average, <b>77.8%</b> of flights were On Time each month and <b>20.2%</b> of flights were Delayed.

The three biggest reasons for flight delays are: 

- National Aviation System accounts for <b>39.7%</b> of all delays, averaging a total of 45,077 minutes each month.
- Late Aircraft accounts for <b>32.8%</b> of all delays, averaging a total of 49,410 minutes each month, which is the <b>longest</b> delay.
- Carrier accounts for <b>23.9%</b> of all delays, averaging a total of 35,021 minutes each month.

The most delays occur in the month of <b>December</b>, which can be accounted towards the National Aviation System, Carrier and Security.   

The longest delays occur in the month of <b>July</b>, which can be accounted towards the Aircraft and Carrier.

The most delays occur in the year <b>2007.</b>

- These delays can be accounted towards the National Aviation System, Aircraft, Carrier and Weather.
- This is also the year with the longest delays overall.
