    "# Airline Delays in the United States (2003-2016)\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis explores 13 years of flight delay data from major U.S. airports. The dataset tracks monthly statistics: how many flights were on time, delayed, cancelled, or diverted, along with what caused those delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Flight delays cost the U.S. economy billions annually. They affect millions of passengers through missed connections, lost productivity, and travel stress. Understanding delay patterns helps airlines improve operations, airports allocate resources better, and passengers make smarter travel decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evolution from the 2021 R Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The original R analysis provided the foundation by identifying key patterns: which months and years had the most delays, what caused them, and how long they lasted. This Python analysis builds on that work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weighted metrics** that give busy airports appropriate influence\n",
    "- **Frequency vs. severity separation** to distinguish how often delays happen from how long they last\n",
    "- **Airport-level profiles** showing which airports perform best and worst\n",
    "- **Composition tracking** to see if delay causes are shifting over time\n",
    "- **Predictive modeling** to understand what drives delays\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Five Types of Delays\n",
    "\n",
    "Every delay gets classified into one of five causes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Carrier**: Problems with the airline itself—maintenance, crew issues, baggage loading, fueling, cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late Aircraft**: When an incoming plane arrives late, the next flight using that same plane departs late (cascading delays)\n",
    "\n",
    "**National Aviation System (NAS)**: Air traffic control holds, airport congestion, high traffic volume\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security**: Security breaches, long TSA lines, terminal evacuations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weather**: Actual meteorological conditions that prevent safe flight operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Period**: June 2003 through December 2016\n",
    "- **Coverage**: 30-50+ major U.S. airports per year\n",
    "- **Structure**: One record per airport per month\n",
    "- **Metrics**: Flight counts, delay causes, total delay minutes"

    "\n",
    "The chart shows on-time and delay rates for each year, weighted by flight volume. This means busy airports like Atlanta influence the numbers more than small regional airports—reflecting the actual passenger experience.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **mid-to-late 2000s were rough**. Performance declined steadily from 2003, hitting bottom in 2007-2008 when nearly a quarter of all flights were delayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then **things got better**. Starting in 2009-2010, delay rates dropped significantly. By 2012-2013, performance reached its best levels of the entire period. Delay rates settled around 15-17%, compared to 23-25% during the 2007-2008 peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why weighted rates matter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without weighting, a tiny airport with 100 flights monthly would count as much as Atlanta with 30,000+ flights. That wouldn't reflect reality. Weighted rates ensure that delays affecting the most passengers carry the most weight in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection to the original analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2021 R analysis found 77.8% of flights were on-time overall, with 20.2% delayed. Our weighted calculations confirm these numbers while adding year-by-year detail that shows how dramatically performance has improved since the 2007-2008 low point."

    "\n",
    "**The breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**NAS (National Aviation System)**: 35-40% of all delays. Air traffic control holds, airport congestion, and high traffic volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late Aircraft**: 30-35% of delays. When the incoming plane is late, your departing flight is late. These delays cascade through the schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Carrier**: 20-25% of delays. Airline-specific problems like maintenance, crew issues, or fueling delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weather**: 5-10% of delays. Thunderstorms, ice, fog—conditions that make flying unsafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security**: Less than 1% of delays. Rare but includes terminal evacuations and security breaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A key difference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Late Aircraft delays take longer to resolve than the others. When you see this cause taking up a bigger slice of total delay minutes than delay count, it means these delays last longer. Cascading delays build on themselves—one late plane affects multiple subsequent flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather follows a similar pattern. You can't fly through a thunderstorm, so you wait. A weather delay might be 30 minutes or 3 hours depending on conditions.\n",

    "**Late Aircraft is consistently second**. In bad years (like 2007), it grows even larger as delays cascade more severely.\n",

    "**Carrier delays shrink in later years**. Airlines have modernized fleets and improved operations, reducing maintenance and crew-related delays.\n",

    "A system can have frequent short delays or rare long delays. This metric separates those two scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Delays typically last 45-65 minutes on average per delayed flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2007 was bad in two ways.** Not only did more flights get delayed, but those delays lasted longer. Double trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2012 onward shows improvement.** Delays became both less frequent AND shorter. This is a big deal—it means airlines got better at preventing delays AND at recovering quickly when they happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes delays longer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cascading effects (one late plane affects many flights)\n",
    "- Infrastructure limits (not enough gates or runways to recover quickly)\n",
    "- Extreme weather (nothing to do but wait for conditions to improve)\n",
    "- Tight schedules (no buffer time built in)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes delays shorter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Schedule padding (buffer time between flights)\n",
    "- Spare aircraft and crews (faster substitutions)\n",
    "- Better turnaround processes (faster boarding and servicing)\n",
    "- Modern fleets (newer planes break down less)\n",

    "The longest delays. Why? Cascading effects. One late plane affects every subsequent flight using that aircraft. The delay compounds through the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airlines can't easily fix this mid-sequence. They'd need to substitute a different plane, which requires spare aircraft to be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. NAS: ~45,000 minutes monthly**\n",
    "\n",
    "Air traffic control holds can last hours. When ATC says wait, you wait. Airlines have zero control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airport congestion creates the same problem—multiple flights stuck waiting for gates or runway slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Carrier: ~35,000 minutes monthly**\n",

    "\n",
    "**4. Weather: Variable**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unpredictable. Could be 30 minutes or 3 hours. You can't fly through a thunderstorm, so everyone waits. Often causes diversions, which create even longer passenger delays.\n",

    "**5. Security: Rare but severe**\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminal evacuations require complete re-screening of all passengers. Security breaches can ground entire terminals. Very low frequency makes the average less meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this means when your flight is delayed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the gate agent says \"late arriving aircraft,\" expect a longer wait. The problem is systemic, not quick-fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "If they say \"air traffic control,\" the airline can't speed it up. You're waiting on ATC clearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If they say \"weather,\" check the radar. You're waiting for conditions to improve.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Understanding RMSE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to MAE but punishes large errors more. If RMSE is much bigger than MAE, the model has some really bad predictions. If they're similar, errors are consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What results tell us about delays:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If both models perform similarly: Delays follow simple, predictable patterns. Basic rules work.\n",
    "\n",
    "If HistGradientBoosting beats ElasticNet significantly: Complex interactions exist (December + Newark + weather = extra bad).\n",
    "\n",
    "If MAE is low: Delays are systematic. Historical patterns, airport identity, and seasonality explain most variation. Airlines can plan for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "If MAE is high: Delays are event-driven and unpredictable. Need real-time data or factors we don't have in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Add weather data, holidays, airline-specific features. If MAE drops significantly, those factors matter. If MAE barely changes, they don't actually drive delays."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Travelers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**September is your best bet.** Consistently the best month across all 14 years. Lower travel demand post-Labor Day, good weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid December.** Consistently the worst month. Holiday crowds, winter weather, and packed airports create delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summer is moderate risk.** June-July see more delays due to thunderstorms and peak travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The industry improved.** Flying in 2012-2016 was significantly more reliable than 2003-2009. Delay rates dropped from 23-25% (2007-2008) to 15-17% (2012-2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Airport Quality Varies Dramatically\n",
    "\n",
    "Best airports: 82-85% on-time\n",
    "Worst airports: 70-73% on-time\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a 10-15 percentage point gap. Your airport matters as much as your travel month.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top performers:** Southwest U.S., West Coast airports with good weather and modern infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Struggling airports:** NYC area (airspace congestion), Chicago (winter weather), Houston (hurricanes)\n",
    "\n",
    "When booking connections, prefer airports with better track records. Build extra buffer time at challenging airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Different Delay Causes Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late Aircraft:** Expect longer waits. Cascading delays through the schedule. The airline needs to substitute another plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Air Traffic Control (NAS):** Could take hours. The airline can't speed this up. You're waiting on ATC clearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weather:** Unpredictable. Could clear in 30 minutes or last hours. Check the radar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maintenance/Carrier:** Variable. Could be a quick fix or require plane substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security:** Rare. If it happens (evacuation, breach), expect major disruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Airlines and Airports\n",
    "\n",
    "### Late Aircraft Is Your Biggest Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "32.8% of delays by count but #1 in total delay time. Cascading effects create the longest passenger delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "- Add schedule padding between flights\n",
    "- Maintain spare aircraft and crews for faster substitution\n",
    "- Improve turnaround processes (faster boarding, servicing)\n",
    "- Proactive rebooking before cascades worsen\n",
    "\n",
    "ROI is high. Reducing late aircraft delays has multiplier effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NAS Delays Need Infrastructure Investment\n",
    "\n",
    "40% of all delays stem from air traffic control and airport capacity constraints. Individual airlines have limited control.\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires policy-level solutions: ATC modernization (NextGen), runway expansion at congested airports, regional airspace optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "What airlines can do: Optimize schedules around ATC bottlenecks, coordinate slot management with other carriers, lobby for infrastructure funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Airport Performance Varies—Learn From the Best\n",
    "\n",
    "Some airports achieve 82-85% on-time despite high volume. Others struggle at 70-73%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Study what top performers do differently: schedule optimization, ground operations efficiency, weather preparedness, infrastructure quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmark against similar airports. If they perform better, operational improvements are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Carrier Delays Are Improving\n",
    "\n",
    "Good news: The 20-25% of delays within airline control (maintenance, crews, ground ops) are decreasing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fleet modernization and operational improvements are working. Continue investing in efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Policymakers\n",
    "\n",
    "### The System Can Improve—We Have Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "Delay rates dropped 10 percentage points from 2007 peak to 2013. The improvement held through 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "This wasn't luck. Airlines reduced schedules (less congestion), modernized fleets, and improved operations. **Interventions work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infrastructure Is the Persistent Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "NAS delays (air traffic control, airport capacity) account for 40% of all delays. Unlike carrier delays, which have improved, NAS delays remain stubbornly high.\n",
    "\n",
    "This points to underinvestment:\n",
    "- Air traffic control runs on 1960s-era technology\n",
    "- Congested airports lack runway/terminal capacity\n",
    "- Regional airspace (NYC, Southern California) is overloaded\n",
    "\n",
    "40% of the delay problem could be addressed with infrastructure funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Airport Quality Gaps Present Opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "National averages hide 10-15 percentage point gaps between best and worst airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Targeted investment in struggling airports could have outsized impact. Best practice sharing from top performers to struggling ones. Regional approaches for multi-airport areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airport reliability affects economic competitiveness. Businesses factor airport quality into location decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weather Delays May Increase\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently 5-8% of delays, but severe weather creates multi-hour disruptions. Climate change may increase frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitor trends beyond 2016. Consider resilience investments: improved de-icing, drainage, alternative routing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Biggest Surprise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Severity improved even more than frequency.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only do fewer flights get delayed now versus 2007, but when delays happen, they get resolved faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means airlines improved at both prevention AND recovery. That represents systematic operational changes, not just favorable conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Still Don't Know\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why was 2007 so bad?** We see it in the data but would need external research (fuel prices, labor disputes, ATC staffing) to explain it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Passenger impact:** A 3% delay rate improvement sounds small statistically but represents millions more passengers arriving on-time. We don't quantify the human or economic impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Airline-specific performance:** Data is aggregated by airport. Can't compare Delta vs. United directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic costs:** We measure minutes, not dollars lost to productivity, missed connections, and hotel costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-2016 trends:** Analysis ends in 2016. Can't speak to COVID impact, recovery, or current performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps to Improve This Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add external weather data (temperature, precipitation, wind)\n",
    "2. Include holiday indicators (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Spring Break)\n",
    "3. Extend to 2017-2025 data for post-COVID patterns\n",
    "4. Break out airline-specific performance\n",
    "5. Model economic impact (convert delay minutes to cost estimates)\n",
    "6. Investigate 2007-2008 root causes through external research\n",
    "7. Compare U.S. performance to international aviation systems"
